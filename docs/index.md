# Welcome to Wyliodrin's documentation page

## libwyliodrin

libwyliodrin is an open source library used for controlling pins on multiple embedded boards. The library is compatible with Raspberry Pi, Intel Galileo (R) and Intel Edison (R), BeagleBone Black and UDOO boards. The library can be used in C/C++, Python and JavaScript projects.  
This platform presents all the available functions together with a detailed description.

## Visual Blocks

Wyliodrin support visual programming besides the classical languages. The visual platform is based on Google Blockly and offers a wide array of elements to be used in writing applications.  
This documentation page explains what each visual element does and how to use it.

## Note

The functions and visual elements described in this documentation can behave differently depending on the board the project runs as the pins' characteristics are different for each hardware. We suggest you document on the placement and behaviour of the pins before writing the applications.
