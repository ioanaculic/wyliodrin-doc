##HIGH
It can be replaced by the value 1. 
##LOW
It can be replaced by the value 0.
##INPUT
It can be replaced by the value 0.
##OUTPUT
It can be replaced by the value 1.
##LSBFIRST
It can be replaced by the value 0.
It stands for Least Significant Bit First and is used as a parameter for [shiftIn](functions.md#shiftin) and [shiftOut](functions.md#shiftout) functions. LSBFIRST implies that the first bit taken into account is the rightmost one.
##MSBFIRST
It can be replaced by the value 1.  
It stands for Most Significant Bit First and is used as a parameter for [shiftIn](functions.md#shiftin) and [shiftOut](functions.md#shiftout) functions. MSBFIRST implies that the first bit taken into account is the leftmost one.
##SPI_MODE0
It can be replaced by the value 0x00 and is used for SPI communication as a parameter to [setDataMode](spi.md#setdatamode) function (CPOL=0, CPHA=0). 
##SPI_MODE1
It can be replaced by the value 0x04 and is used for SPI communication as a parameter to [setDataMode](spi.md#setdatamode) function (CPOL=0, CPHA=1).
##SPI_MODE2
It can be replaced by the value 0x08 and is used for SPI communication as a parameter to [setDataMode](spi.md#setdatamode) function (CPOL=1, CPHA=0).
##SPI_MODE3
It can be replaced by the value 0x0C and is used for SPI communication as a parameter to [setDataMode](spi.md#setdatamode) function (CPOL=1, CPHA=1).
##SPI_CLOCK_DIV2
It can be replaced by the value 0x04 and is used for SPI communication as a parameter to [setClockDivider](spi.md#setclockdivider) function.
